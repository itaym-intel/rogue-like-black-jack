A reference list of all player-available equipment, consumables, and curses currently in the game.

## Tier System (Hidden to the player)
All Equipment and Consumables have tiers, which are represented as (T1/2/3) in this document.

- How this affects Equipment:
  - An Equipment from T1 cannot be found in shops after the Stage 1 boss is defeated. At this stage the player will only see Equipment from T2. Then when the player defeats the Stage 2 boss, they will only see Equipment from T3.

- How this affects Consumables:
  - Consumables from previous tiers can always be found in the shop.
    - Ex: After the player defeats the Stage 1 boss, they can still see a T1 Consumable, as well as T2 Consumables.
  - Even though previous tiers of Consumables CAN be found in the shops, they are less likely to be found. Below is the rate for Consumable spawns by tier per Stage X Boss defeated:
    - No Boss Defeated: 100% T1
    - Stage 1 Boss Defeated: 15% T1, 85% T2
    - Stage 2 Boss Defeated: 15% T1, 15% T2, 70% T3

Equipment from the next tier can be taken in place of current equipment, by simply purchasing the higher tier equipment.
  - Ex: T1 Helm can be replaced with a T2 or T3 Helm by simply purchasing the new item.
