We want a rogue-like blackjack game where the player is able to play black jack and over the course of the game modify different parts of blackjack
in a variety of ways to have a unique "run" and this will involve many modification of the basic rules of blackjack. Thus we must design in such a way
that every single thing written is modular and has the ability to change. We want a very large array of possible interactions and combinations of how
the player can choose to interact with the core game of blackjack.
