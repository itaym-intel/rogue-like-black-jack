The backend of this game should be completely split from the ways in which the player interacts with the game. The backend should be accessable through and interface such that a cli or a graphical interface could interact with the backend in the same function. Nothing about the state of the game nor the mechanics should be handeled by the method of interaction, cli of gui. Everything about the state of the game should exist in the backend and be fully deterministic. Despite the game being based around randomness, every random interaction should be based on the set random seed.
